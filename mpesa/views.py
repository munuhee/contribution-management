"""
Handles MPESA payment validation and confirmation in Django.

This module provides views for processing MPESA payment notifications:
1. `MpesaValidationView`: A placeholder for handling payment
validation requests.
2. `MpesaConfirmationView`: Processes payment confirmations,
updates member accounts, and handles penalties.

Key Features:
- Matches payments to members using the bill reference number.
- Updates member balances and pays off penalties if applicable.
- Saves unmatched transactions for later review.

Dependencies:
- CSRF exemption for handling external MPESA requests.
- Models:
  - `Transaction` for storing successful payments.
  - `UnmatchedTransaction` for payments that canâ€™t be matched to a member.
  - `Penalty` for handling unpaid penalties.
  - `Member` for managing member accounts.
